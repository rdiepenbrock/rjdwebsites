			<p>Welcome to rjdWebsites.com, the online portfolio website for <a href="mailto:rjd@rjdwebsites.com">Richard Diepenbrock</a>.</p>
			<p>My experience in web development has spanned industries from online newspaper publishing to financial centers. I have worked on teams as small as five and larger than 20.</p>
			<p>While front end web development has been the primary focus throughout my career, I have begun to develop applications in Laravel PHP framework, and the Homestead/VirtualBox virtual machine, moving away from the Microsoft/.Net environment in which I had grown accustomed.</p>
			<p>My career arc with bullets:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I continue to learn and use the latest technologies to build websites and applications, including bootstrap, php, wordpress, css and html.</li>
				<li>In my time at Carnegie Technologies I chose to transition from front end into a Laravel PHP developer to meet the needs of the business.</li>
				<li>As a Consultant with Catapult Systems, I was involved with a variety of projects and clients, both on-site and remote. My primary role was SharePoint branding - styling display templates, master pages and publishing pages - in CSS, HTML and XSLT for both customer-facing websites and Intranet sites.</li>
				<li>During my time with Acquinity Interactive (f/k/a ModernAd Media), I developed and maintained web sites such as AmericanCreditReport.com and Sweepstakes.com, coordinating with designers and programmers to integrate the front and back end code architectures.</li>
				<li>While at Tera US, I built and deployed client web sites in the Kentico content management system and went on-site to conduct training sessions in the same CMS. This work included using CSS, XHTML, Javascript and JQuery languages, and an understanding and ability to work with XML, .Net and C#.</li>
				<li>And have worn the title of both webmaster (Big12.net and FanaticZone.com) and project manager â€“ during the development of a sports stats engine - at Morris DigitalWorks.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <a href="/eclasses/">Development area</a> contains examples of the latest coding and scripting experiments I have undertaken.</p>
